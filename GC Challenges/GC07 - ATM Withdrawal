Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.


atm = 150

withdrawal = float(input("how much money would you like to withdraw? "))

if withdrawal % 5 == 0 and withdrawal <= 145.5:
    print("PROCESSING \n")
    remaining = atm - withdrawal - 0.5
    print("amount remaining in your account:", remaining)
else:
    print("FAILURE \namount withdrawn must be divisible by 5 and less than amount in account")
