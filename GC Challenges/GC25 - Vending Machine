Write a program to simulate a vending machine. You should be able to put coins in, select a product and then output the product and any change left over. You choose what your vending machine vends and the amount items cost.

list = "Snickers","Coke","fx-570ES-PLUS"

print("Welcome to the new GIS Vending Machine!")
print("We have",list,"on sale! \n")

Snickers = 2.5
Coke = 3
fx570 = 69

a = input("What would you like to buy? ")

if a == "Snickers":
    snickinp = float(input("Great! That'll be $2.5"))
    print("Here is your Snickers! Your change is",(snickinp - 2.5))
elif a == "Coke":
    cokeinp = float(input("Great! That'll be $3"))
    print("Here is your Coke! Your change is",(cokeinp - 3))
elif a == "fx570":
    fxinp = float(input("Great! That'll be $69"))
    print("Here is your fx-570ES-PLUS! Your change is",(fxinp - 69))
